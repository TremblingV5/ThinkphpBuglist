## What was applied to this project?

- PHP

- Thinkphp 5.0.24

- Bootstrap 3

## How to run

- Apache/Nginx
- MySQL
- PHP

## Mainly features

- Record bugs in other project with some infos such as who rasing it , who is responsible for it , what was the time it was created , what was the time it was updated and so on.
- Of course , we can set people who maybe raise some bugs or will be responsible for some bugs . 
- We also can set some status . Use status to descript a bug , it will be obvious.

## Next plans

- I want to define the project formally , I will consider what features are needed . 
- I will learn laravel or other PHP frame , may be I will use other frame rewrite it .
- I will use Vue or React to rewrite front pages.
